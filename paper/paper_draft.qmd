# Introduction
Anthropogenic climate change is rapidly altering the abundance and ranges of species (Hastings et al. 2020; Pinsky et al. 2020; Poloczanska et al. 2013; Sorte et al. 2010), community composition (Beukhof et al. 2019; Flanagan et al. 2019; Sorte et al. 2017), and ecosystem energy flow and production (du Pontavice et al. 2021). Individuals are exposed to conditions unsuitable for survival, growth or reproduction, leading to declines in population abundance and ecosystem interactions. Understanding potential impacts and species responses, through quantification of climate risk, is important for the development of conservation and management strategies (Foden et al. 2018), particularly for fisheries species where yield and sustainability depend on population and ecosystem dynamics (Brander et al. 2017).

Climate change risk assessment requires knowledge of three interconnected features: vulnerability, exposure and hazard. The vulnerability of a species refers to its susceptibility and predisposition to be negatively affected by climate change (IPCC 2022). The vulnerability of a species is determined by its sensitivity and adaptability to environmental conditions. A hazard is considered as the potential for unfavourable conditions and events to occur that could negatively impact a species (IPCC 2022). Exposure is when a species occurs at the same time and location as a climate hazard (IPCC 2022). Climate risk assessments aim to quantify these features and understand the pressures a species is facing. 

Common methods used for climate risk assessment include quantitative trait-based, mechanistic and correlative approaches (Foden et al. 2018). Correlative methods involve projecting the suitability of future conditions relative to a modelled ecological niche for a species. This approach is scalable, reproducible and time- and cost-effective, particularly for a data-poor species (Foden et al. 2018). Correlative assessments provide a metric of climate suitability, often on a scale from 0-1 with 1 representing the most suitable conditions. While conventional correlative approaches provide effective tools for detecting future climate differences from historical and present conditions, they are limited to habitat suitability predictions within the historical ecological niche and are forced to predict ex situ responses (e.g. migration) once future conditions exceed the species current ecological niche. Recently (Kim et al. 2023) adapted ecological niche modelling methods to consider varying levels of suitability outside the niche space to overcome the shortcomings of conventional correlative approaches, quantifying changes in suitability within and beyond the historical ecological niche as climate risk scores. This climate risk score metric was used to examine varying levels of in situ climate disturbance outside historical thresholds, where species would be exposed to conditions beyond those previously experienced (Kim et al. 2023). Similar methods methods and applications have been used in other studies such as (Perez-Navarro et al. 2022). Trait-based and mechanistic assessments can also be effective, but have large time, cost and data requirements, which may delay assessments (Foden et al. 2018). Correlative approaches provide indices of and highlight where and when species experience climate risk, informing management and conservation strategies. 

In response to risk, species can exhibit two main responses: migration or adaptation, or face local extirpation (Donelson et al. 2019; Nogués-Bravo et al. 2018). Many studies focus on predicting these responses for a species, but a response may not translate to a beneficial outcome. For example, being highly adapted to local environmental conditions in spawning and dispersal locations, climate-driven movement may lead to species inhabiting unfavourable reproduction conditions (Ciannelli et al. 2015; Dahlke et al. 2020; Neuheimer et al. 2018). Marine species are commonly predicted to migrate towards the poles and follow climate trajectories closely in latitude and depth (Pinsky et al. 2013; Poloczanska et al. 2013). Focussing only on poleward shifts can lead to underestimation of magnitudes and rates of species shifts as suitable climates shift in a multitude of directions depending on local climate velocities (Pinsky et al. 2013; VanDerWal et al. 2013). Species distribution modelling under climate change can also exhibit low predictive capacity for future species ranges (Santini et al. 2021). Instead of forecasting future movement of a species, assessing the underlying climate risk to a species allows us to identify the populations and regions most or least impacted by climate pressures. Such climate risk assessments will help to understand patterns in climate impacts, focus further research efforts and develop adaptive measures to conserve seafood security.

Seriola lalandi (Valenciennes, 1833), commonly referred to as Yellowtail Kingfish in Australasia, is a large coastal pelagic fish found throughout temperate and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific and south-east Atlantic waters (Allen 2009). S. lalandi inhabits coastal zones, offshore reefs, and seamount ecosystems at depths of less than 150m (Allen 2009; Morales et al. 2021; Stewart & Hughes 2008; Victorian Fisheries Authority 2020). Little is currently known about the spawning conditions and behaviours of wild fish. S. lalandi in captivity spawn repeatedly over the austral spring/summer seasons when water temperatures exceed 17°C, producing large numbers of positively buoyant eggs (Diggles 2002; Moran et al. 2007). The species is a top predator, feeding on small pelagic fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods (Dunn 2014; Morales et al. 2021). Yellowtail Kingfish is also a crucial species for large commercial and recreational fisheries in Japan (Shiraishi et al. 2010), California (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2023), Mexico (Erisman et al. 2010), Chile (Sepúlveda & González 2017), Australia (Hughes et al. 2020), New Zealand (McKenzie et al. 2014) and South Africa (Parker et al. 2017).

Studies have shown the Yellowtail Kingfish comprises multiple genetically distinct populations across the globe. Specifically, four genetically distinct populations occurring in the North-East Pacific (California and Mexico), North-West Pacific (Japan and Korea), South-Indo Pacific (Australia, New Zealand South-Pacific Islands and Chile), and the South-East Atlantic (South Africa) @fig-kingfish-map; (Martinez-Takeshita et al. 2015; Nugroho et al. 2001; Premachandra et al. 2017; Purcell et al. 2015; Swart et al. 2016). There are conflicting suggestions for and against elevating these populations to separate species (Martinez-Takeshita et al. 2015; Premachandra et al. 2017; Purcell et al. 2015), without a clear consensus. Genetic distinction also occurs within these populations, including within the Australasian region (Miller et al. 2011), South African region (Kerwath et al. 2021) and South-East Pacific region (Sepúlveda & González 2017). Some of these distinct populations of S. lalandi experience different climate conditions and are projected to be exposed to varying future climate trajectories (Fox-Kemper et al. 2021).

Climate risk assessments are often performed at the species-level, however population-level risk assessments can provide insights that may be more relevant to local fisheries stock management (Li et al. 2022b). Yellowtail Kingfish has been qualitatively assessed, focussing on regional traits such as fecundity, mobility and recruitment through expert knowledge, to experience low to medium climate risk in eastern Australia (Creighton et al. 2013; Pecl et al. 2011) and South Africa (Ortega-Cisneros et al. 2018).  In China correlative risk analysis suggests decreasing suitability for S. lalandi under future climate change for offshore aquaculture (Wu et al. 2024). On the eastern coast of Australia, correlative (Champion et al. 2018) and multi-criteria analyses (Champion et al. 2023) suggest increasing habitat suitability for S. lalandi in in the southern extent of the species range during winter. However , the extent and trends in climate risk throughout the species’ range beyond the two regions remain unknown. Genetically and geographically distinct populations are likely to experience different levels of climate risk because they are adapted to distinct climate niches (Ikeda et al. 2017; Li et al. 2022b; Smith et al. 2019). Population level climate risk assessment provides regionally relevant information for management strategies, considering the differences in climate niches and future trajectories across regions. 
This investigation aims to quantify the extent of climate risk for genetically distinct populations of Seriola lalandi at a global scale using a novel ecological niche modelling approach. We aim to examine changes in climate risk among populations of S. lalandi from 2001 to 2100. We aim to investigate the differences in reported risk levels when analysing climate risk at and below the species level. Additionally, we aim to investigate the differences in climate risk experienced by adult and embryonic life stages of S. lalandi.

We hypothesize that geographic patterns of increasing future risk will closely follow local patterns of historical exposure, and future climate trajectories (Fox-Kemper et al. 2021; Pinsky et al. 2013; Poloczanska et al. 2013). We hypothesize that genetically-distinct populations, locally adapted to narrower historical niches, will experience greater climate risk levels compared to the species as a whole (Angert et al. 2011; Ikeda et al. 2017; Li et al. 2022b; Smith et al. 2019). Finally, we hypothesize that the embryonic life stage, adapted to dispersal on the sea surface will experience greater climate risk than adult Seriola lalandi as adult fish are able to move across a depth range in response to climate pressures (Ciannelli et al. 2015; Dahlke et al. 2020; Morales et al. 2021; Pinsky et al. 2013).

# Methods
Like conventional ecological niche modelling approaches, we use known species occurrence records and past climate conditions to construct the historical ecological niche of the species. Here, this multivariate niche is defined as the climate vulnerability space, and outside of this niche is considered to impose hazardous conditions for the species. We then assess future environmental conditions at each occurrence record over time for their location within or outside the vulnerability space. By measuring the proximity of an environmental coordinate (time-specific environmental conditions of an occurrence record within or outside vulnerability space) to hazardous conditions and optimum conditions, a climate risk score is generated for the location at a specific time (Figure 3). 

## Occurrence data
Occurrence data, as coordinate points, of S. lalandi are obtained from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) (OBIS 2023) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (GBIF 2023). Combined and filtered for duplicates, these data are further restricted to regions with available genetic information. Occurrences are separated into four main populations identified in recent genetic studies (Figure 1; (Martinez-Takeshita et al. 2015; Nugroho et al. 2001; Premachandra et al. 2017; Purcell et al. 2015; Swart et al. 2016). Due to the spatial resolution of the climate data (see below), coordinates too close to the coastline without available climate data are moved to the closest spatial grid with available data (Sillero et al. 2021). Occurrence records are thinned using the `thin` function from package spThin (Aiello-Lammens et al. 2015) to reduce artificial clustering that can occur when different observation sources are collated in occurrence databases. A 100km thinning distance is used to match the spatial resolution of environmental data (total occurrence point sample size = 217: South Pacific n=127, South Africa n=28, North-West Pacific n=14, North-East Pacific n=48). 

## Climate data
Climate data are obtained from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) database for Earth System Model products of the Sixth phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) (ESGF 2022). Monthly modelled data are downloaded for five Earth System Models (ESMs) encompassing three resolutions 100km (CESM2-WACCM, CMCC-ESM2, NorESM2-LM), 1° (GFDL-ESM4) and 50km (MPI-ESM1-2-HR). These models are selected as they contained historical, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios with available NO3, pH, salinity and temperature data at a monthly frequency. There is low evidence for nitrate concentrations commonly found in marine environments to directly impact the physiology of fishes (Edwards et al. 2023; Torno et al. 2025). However, there is increasing inclusion of nutrient variables such as nitrate and chlorophyll-a concentrations in species distribution modelling as drivers of phytoplankton, the basis of marine food webs particularly in temperate ecosystems (Husson et al. 2020; Jensen et al. 2017; Mondal et al. 2021). Dissolved O2 showed high collinearity with temperature and was not available for CESM2-WACCM, and therefore is excluded from analyses. The ESMs are confirmed to fit within the recommended range of 1.4-2.2 Transient Climate Response (TCR) (Hausfather et al. 2022). Bilinear interpolation was used to transform data to a consistent 1° resolution grid. 
Shared Socio-Economic pathways describe sets of socio-economic trends that project future levels of emissions and radiative forcing from 2015 to 2100 (IPCC 2022; Kriegler et al. 2014). The first pathway, SSP1-2.6, represents a scenario of dramatic greenhouse gas emissions reduction, causing global average surface temperatures to increase by 1.8°C by 2100 (IPCC 2022). This scenario is used to examine the benefits of large-scale emission reduction for the species. The second pathway, SSP2-4.5, represents a more likely future scenario, compared to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, with moderate levels of emission reduction leading to 2.7°C of warming by 2100 (Hausfather & Peters 2020; IPCC 2022). The final parthway considered in this study, SSP5-8.5, represents a scenario of increasing future emissions resulting in a projected temperature increase of 4.4°C (IPCC 2022). SSP5-8.5 is used in this study as a worst case scenario, although represented future emission levels are unlikely (Hausfather & Peters 2020).
While limited published literature on the depth preferences of S. lalandi suggests the fish primarily inhabit the upper 80m of water (Morales et al. 2021; Victorian Fisheries Authority 2020), 98% of occurrences from OBIS and GBIF datasets were recorded within 150m of the surface. To examine the plausibility of future depth refugia, environmental conditions between 0 and 150m were included in the characterisation of the species’ ecological niches. As the numbers and boundaries of depth layers vary among CMIP6 models, depth bins are created to standardise data across ESMs. A surface depth bin of 0 to 10m is used to capture the fine scale vertical resolution offered by CMCC-EMS2 at the surface level. Subsurface depth bins include 10-50m (50m), 50-100m (100m) and 100-150m (150m). Climate data are then extracted at each occurrence location to create a dataset of relevant conditions. 

## Quantifying vulnerability
Vulnerability refers to how predisposed a species is to harm due to climate pressures. Species traits that influence the species’ performance such as dispersal, are impacted by environmental conditions and define the limits of their range (Kearney & Porter 2009). For species with limited trait-based information, biophysical evaluation of their past and present geographic range has been used to quantify vulnerability and to define their tolerable environmental conditions (IPCC 2022). To quantify species’ vulnerability, all past conditions the species has experienced are assessed. The methods used in this investigation (Figures 2-3) follow those used to define species’ climatic niches (Broennimann et al. 2021; Perez-Navarro et al. 2022) and determine climate risk (Kim et al. 2023). 
A dataset of past conditions is collated by extracting historical environmental conditions for each month at each observation point. The model ensemble mean is taken for each month, location, water depth and scenario. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to rotate normalised data and to capture a sufficient proportion of variation in the data (Perez-Navarro et al. 2022). PCA is performed on data including all populations and depths for historical and future data (each future scenario is analysed separately). 
The population vulnerability is expressed as a population-specific niche, created by projecting a hull that encompasses the 95% confidence region of the historical conditions (Figure 2). Similar methods of niche definition, such as a convex hull, encompass all historical conditions but may include outlier condition points within the niche space (Carrasco et al. 2022). The use of 95% confidence intervals alleviates this limitation by excluding conditions outside of the 95% confidence range and giving these locations high baseline risk levels. This confidence region of the historical PC data is calculated using the `distfree.cr` package (Hu & Yang 2013). A historical reference period between 1850 and 2000 is used to encompass a wide range of modern conditions, while allowing the recent decades’ climate-driven trends to contribute to climate hazards. The outer edges of the polygon represent the most marginal conditions that the population experienced during the historical period. To identify the optimal historical conditions, historical PC data are adjusted for spatio-temporal autocorrelation using the R `INLA` package (Lindgren & Rue 2015), and the mean of these values is taken as the population ‘centroid’. These adjusted values are only used for centroid calculation. An ‘environmental coordinate’ is equivalent to a time-specific set of environmental conditions at an occurrence point, and moves with changes in environmental conditions over time (Figure 2). Conditions outside of the vulnerability niche space are considered climate hazards as they are completely dissimilar to historical conditions the populations experienced.

## Multivariate climate risk scores 
Species exposure to climate hazards is defined where an environmental coordinate occurs outside of the vulnerability space boundaries. To quantify where an environmental coordinate occurs relative to favourable and hazardous conditions, centrality and marginality in vulnerability space should be considered (Perez-Navarro et al. 2022; Santini et al. 2019). Centrality is measured as the centroid distance (dC; @fig-mcrs-diagram), showing how far the occurrence is from its optimum conditions at a particular point in time and space (Perez-Navarro et al. 2022). Marginality is measured as the edge distance (dE; @fig-mcrs-diagram), showing proximity to hazardous conditions relative to the population centroid.

![Visual representation of the vulnerability space and multivariate climate risk score (mCRS) within and outside of the vulnerability space. The polygon represents the boundaries of the vulnerability hull. The central point of the polygon represents the climate vulnerability hull centroid (i.e., hypothetical environmental optimum). The small point in the polygon represents the environmental coordinates of a species occurrence at a specific time. Centroid distance (dC) is the Euclidean distance from an environmental coordinate to the centroid (solid radial line). Edge distance (dE) is the sum of the solid and dashed lines extending from the centroid to the hull boundary, calculated as the closest distance from the centroid to the hull boundary via the environmental coordinate. The mCRS values are lowest at the centroid, increasing linearly outwards toward the polygon edges. A positive mCRS value occurring outside the polygon indicates climate risk is present (i.e., exposure to hazards). This approach to mCRS calculation captures differing levels of condition suitability outside of the environmental niche space. It is important to note that this figure and the vulnerability hull do not include any geographical information, only environmental conditions. Blue and green colours indicate negative climate risk (suitable conditions), while red colours indicate positive climate risk (hazardous conditions). Figure adapted from Kim et al. (2023).](/../../kingfish_data_dir/Results/Plots/mcrs_diagram.png){#fig-mcrs-diagram width=}

The multivariate Climate Risk Score (mCRS) for an environmental coordinate is quantified as:
〖mCRS〗_tj=〖dC〗_tj/〖dE〗_tj -1
Where t represents a timepoint and j represents a kingfish occurrence location.
This formula ensures an mCRS value is proportional to an environmental coordinate’s distance to favourable conditions at the population centroid and hazardous conditions beyond the population’s niche boundary. mCRS values are negative inside the vulnerability hull and positive beyond the hull boundary, indicating the presence of potential climate hazards (@fig-mcrs-diagram). 
All locations are expected to experience a certain level of background risk during the historical period based on fluctuations in environmental conditions. To measure future changes in climate risk, and the difference from a location’s background level of risk, ΔmCRS values are calculated as:
〖ΔmCRS〗_tj=〖mCRS〗_tj- 〖μmCRS〗_((1850-2000)j)
Where t represents a timepoint, j represents a kingfish occurrence location, and 〖μmCRS〗_((1850-2000)j) represents the mean historical mCRS value at location j.
A negative ΔmCRS value means that a location is experiencing lower mCRS levels than the background mean mCRS and a positive ΔmCRS value indicates that a location is experiencing increased climate risk compared to that location’s mean background levels.
In summary, mCRS values indicate a location’s climate risk relative to the population’s historical niche, referred to as regional climate risk. ΔmCRS values indicate a location’s climate risk relative to that location’s historical risk levels, and are therefore referred to as local climate risk. 

## Results analysis

## Limitations and caveats
Some assumptions and limitations exist with the methods used in this study. Firstly, as future adaptation and refugia cannot be considered without robust predictions of biodiversity responses at a global scale, this method examines changes in habitat suitability without considering future adaptation or migration. Secondly, this method assumes that occurrence records capture aspects of the species’ ecology that may influence climate risk, such as inter- and intra-specific interactions. There is limited published knowledge about the spawning behaviours and locations of wild mature S. lalandi. As a result, all locations are assumed to be possible locations where spawning may occur and all locations are retained in the modelling of kingfish dispersal stage climate risk. It is acknowledged that sampling bias may be present, potentially underestimating the distribution of the species (Rondinini et al. 2006) and the range of conditions they have experienced. It is assumed an accurate realised niche for the species is created and species occurrences exist at all locations where survival and dispersal have been possible (Sillero et al. 2021). Due to limited availability of physiological information, it is assumed that the conditions are optimum at the population centroid and decay linearly outwards, with hazardous conditions increasing linearly outside the vulnerability boundary.

A limitation of this investigation is that niches are defined by conditions from the entire reference period although the species may only occur at a location for a reduced period of time each year. Ideally, future analyses could address this issue by creating separate niches for each month or season, or examining the temporal distribution of occurrence records by population. However, due to limited temporal information attached to occurrence data, this method involves the segmentation of occurrence sets that already have reduced sample sizes, for example in the North-West Pacific. A temporal approach may be susceptible to temporal biases in occurrence data due to fishing pressure, accessibility or recording. Future analyses could also include more refined considerations of kingfish spawning grounds if the data were to become available.

# Results
## Climate change mitigation

ΔmCRS values (local climate risk) are used to indicate the amount of change in mCRS a location experiences compared to it’s historical (1850-2000) level of climate risk. As the SSP scenarios increase in severity local climate risk levels increase in magnitude and variation (pvalue, @fig-deltacrs-proportion). This is most noticeable in the North-West Pacific and South-Pacific populations (@fig-deltacrs-proportion).

End of century multivariate climate risk scores (mCRS) are significantly reduced when assessed as an entire species with a single historical climate niche, compared to assessing each genetically distinct population with a distinct historic climate niche (βspecies = -0.17, p < 0.001). This relationship between niche analysis level and mCRS is further enhanced as the climate scenario increases in severity, as evidenced by the interaction between analysis level and SSP scenario, βspecies*SSP2-4.5 = -0.18 (p < 0.001), βspecies*SSP5-8.5 = -0.60 (p < 0.001).

## Dispersal life stages
mCRS are significantly increased when only the surface level of depth (0-10m) is included in the historical climate niche characterisation for each population (βsurface = 0.22, p < 0.001). Increasingly severe future climate scenarios exacerbate this effect, as evidenced by the interaction between surface depth differences and SSP scenario, βsurface*SSP2-4.5 = 0.25 (p < 0.001), with the greatest interaction occurring under SSP5-8.5 βsurface*SSP5-8.5 = 1.04 (p < 0.001).

## Spatial patterns of climate risk
Local geographic patterns in climate risk are intensified under more severe SSP scenarios. Negative local climate risk levels are an indication that a location experiences decreased climate risk (CRS) compared to historical risk levels, while positive climate risk levels indicate that a location will experience increased climate risk compared to future levels. Across depths ocean pH shows the most dramatic change into the future and local risk levels are highly influenced by spatial patterns in historical levels and future change of pH.

### Surface depths (10m & 50m)
![Environmental change map 10m](/../outputs/ADRIA_results/HighResCoralStress/figs/region_map.png){#fig-kingfish-map width=}

![PCA change map 10m](/../outputs/ADRIA_results/HighResCoralStress/figs/region_map.png){#fig-kingfish-map width=}

At surface depths future decreases in climate risk (negative ΔmCRS values) are widespread, particularly in the North-East Pacific population, South-Eastern locations of the South African population and locations in the northern limits of the Australian range. These decreases in climate risk are primarily due to these locations having suboptimal pH, NO3 or salinity levels historically, compared to the broader population’s niche, and conditions becoming more favourable in these variables into the future. 
In the South African population these locations with decreasing future climate risk have high levels of future acidification, this suggests that historically they have occupied locations that have suboptimal pH, and future pH changes are increasing their suitability. In the South African locations that experience increases in climate risk into the future, future increases in temperature and decreases in nitrate are likely to contribute to these risk increases for historically niche-central locations (Figure 1, Figure 2). In the North-East Pacific population there is widespread decrease in climate risk into the future for the surface depths. This is likely due to these shallow depths being marginal in the species niche historically, with future changes, primarily in temperature, pH and nitrate, moving towards the population’s centroid (Figure 2). In the South Pacific population, there is decreased local risk in the northern parts of the S. lalandi range. Similar to the locations on the west coast of South Africa, these decreasing risk locations experience marginal conditions historically at surface depths leading to decreases in risk as conditions shift towards the niche centroid (Figure 2). 
While low levels of local climate risk are widespread in the North-West Pacific population, this population has two locations with local climate risk levels among the highest of any locations globally (Figure 2). These locations experience high levels of future change in NO3 concentration and pH compared to other locations in the population, leading to high local climate risk despite occupying marginal conditions historically (Figure 1). These locations occur on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, whereas locations with lower local risk levels occur in the seas between Korea and Japan, and on the South-East side of Japan. The South-Pacific population also contains locations with high future risk increases, predominantly in the Southern Pacific and South-Western Australian regions. These locations have salinity levels that are historically higher than the population mean levels, meaning that further future increase in salinity leads to large future increases in risk for these locations (Figure 1, Figure 2).

## Deep depths (100m & 150m)
![Environmental change map 100m](/../outputs/ADRIA_results/HighResCoralStress/figs/region_map.png){#fig-kingfish-map width=}

![Environmental change map 100m](/../outputs/ADRIA_results/HighResCoralStress/figs/region_map.png){#fig-kingfish-map width=}

At deep depths, particularly 150m depth, increasing local risk levels are widespread through all populations (Figure 3, Figure 5). Refugia from increasing future climate risk at these depths are only seen in small regions in the eastern South African population, Japan in the North-West Pacific population, and the northern extents of the Australian range. These are locations where risk has decreased as the locations are marginal historically and the direction of environmental change shifts towards niche conditions in the future (Figure 4, Figure 6). 

The highest local risk levels occur in the southern-South African, south Australian, northern New Zealand and Californian regions. These locations have high levels of change in multiple variables (Figure 3, Figure 5). Additionally, these locations are historically marginal in their conditions with the direction of changing conditions leading to large increases in climate risk (Figure 4, Figure 6).   

# Discussion
## Climate change mitigation
ΔmCRS results under each future climate scenario support the hypothesis that as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change severity increase under each SSP, climate risk for S. lalandi will increase. The greatest differences between the future climate scenarios occur in the North-West and South-Pacific populations, while the lowest differences occur in the North-East Pacific and South African populations. 

## Species vs genetic-population analyses
The results of this investigation support the hypothesis that analysing climate risk using genetic-population level niches will result in high climate risk levels. High risk levels when using a genetic-population level niche are likely caused by the narrower range of historical conditions that are used in niche characterisation compared to species level analyses that use the entire range of a species to characterise a broader niche. This is in agreement with literature (Angert et al. 2011; Ikeda et al. 2017; Li et al. 2022b; Smith et al. 2019) suggesting that correlative climate risk assessments can be improved by quantifying the niche below the species level, incorporating local adaptation within subspecies and genetically-distinct populations.

Genetic-population level niche characterisation has been previously used for the North-West Pacific population when assessing regional suitability for aquaculture developments (Wu et al. 2024). On the other hand, previous species distribution modelling for S. lalandi within the South-Pacific population has had a focus on south-eastern Australia, assessing climate suitability below the population level (Champion et al. 2019). This approach allows for the direct use of fisheries-tagging records of possibly more consistent quality and coverage than globally compiled occurrence records. However, limiting the spatial range of occurrence points considered may overestimate future risk by limiting the range of conditions the species have experienced in the past, particularly for highly mobile species such as S. lalandi that have been shown to migrate large distances with limited evidence for genetic distinction within the eastern Australia-New Zealand region (Gillanders et al. 2001; Miller et al. 2011). Further investigation of climate risk for the South-Pacific population could incorporate distinct climate niches based on the sup-population genetic distinction found between S. lalandi in western Australian regions and those in southern/eastern Australia and south Pacific Ocean regions by Miller et al. (2011).

## Dispersal life stages
While little is currently known about the spawning grounds and reproductive behaviours of S. lalandi, it is known that the species’ eggs are positively buoyant and larvae/juveniles are likely dispersed passively via ocean hydrology (Diggles 2002; Moran et al. 2007). Climate risk for the dispersal life stages of S.lalandi was assessed by creating a climate niche encompassing only the 10m depth bin. The results from this analysis supported the hypothesis that the dispersal life stages will experience greater climate risk as they are restricted to, and likely adapted to, the conditions that occur in the top 10m of the ocean.

These results are supported by Dahlke et al. (2020) who suggest that embryonic life stages of fish species are the most vulnerable to future changes in temperature as a result of narrower temperature ranges and lower aerobic capacity compared to adult and larval life stages. This suggests that not considering the conditions that embryonic and dispersal life stage S. lalandi experience will lead to an underestimation of climate change impacts on the species. Hook et al. (2025) found juvenile Kingfish display potential mechanisms for acclimation to sub-lethal thermal stress. While acclimation may be possible in developing and adult fish, egg and larval life stages likely remain one of the most sensitive life stages for the species with decreasing development success under temperature and salinity extremes (Santerre 1976).

## Spatial patterns of climate risk
Previously quantitative climate suitability modelling has been performed for areas in eastern Australia and the North-West Pacific population. In the North-West Pacific population, Wu et al. (2024) used sea surface and bottom temperature, salinity and velocity variables to model future aquaculture suitability for S. lalandi in the region. Similar to Wu et al. (2024), we found low levels of local climate risk in the regions between Japan and the southern/eastern Korean peninsula, and high levels of climate risk, or habitat unsuitability, in the Yellow Sea surrounding the western side of the Korean peninsula. The spatially similar results between these investigations are likely to due similar population/occurrence location extents used, as well as incorporating both surface and subsurface variables. The high levels of future local climate risk in the Yellow Sea region are supported by findings indicating high levels of acidification and eutrophication in the region (Li et al. 2022a; Yang et al. 2018). While there is evidence for water column stratification in the Yellow Sea region (Guo et al. 2020; Li et al. 2022a) and PCA positions for locations in this region differ across depths, relative levels of environmental change and niche positioning lead to similar levels of local climate risk occurring across the depths. The North-West Pacific population’s climate niche was characterised using only 14 different locations in the region due to availability of occurrence records available. This limitation may lead to a reduced characterisation of the population’s niche and further analyses would benefit from a broader collection of occurrence points for this population.

In eastern Australia, previous quantitative habitat suitability modelling by Champion et al. (2018, 2023), suggested there will be future increases in habitat suitability for S. lalandi on the southern east coast of Australia surrounding southern New South Wales (NSW), eastern Victoria and Tasmania, and future decreases in suitability in the northern NSW region. This investigation does not support this suggestion as we identified the northern NSW-southern Queensland region of the species range as experiencing low future levels of local climate risk, and the region surrounding NSW and Tasmania as experiencing high levels of future local climate risk at 100 and 150m depths. The differences in these results across the investigations are likely due to the different spatial occurrence extents and vertical variability considered. Champion et al. (2018, 2023) considered many occurrence locations within a limited spatial range, which may result in a limited characterisation of the species climate niche compared to using a genetic-population level extent of occurrences.

While high future local climate risk is widespread throughout the four populations of S. lalandi, locations in the north-eastern extent of the South-Africa population, southern Japan, and northern Western Australia, experience low or no increases in future climate risk across all depth levels. These occurrences may act as future refugia from high climate risk levels as climate change intensifies. In contrast, there are locations in southern Western Australia, South Australia and northern New Zealand where S. lalandi are exposed to high future levels of local climate risk at all depths. These results are supported by climate change driven trends of highly increasing salinity in south Western Australia (Pearce & Feng 2007) and New Zealand (Cummings et al. 2021). Additionally, large changes in salinity in these high-risk regions have the potential to impact the buoyancy of pelagic S. lalandi eggs (Nissling et al. 2017; Petereit et al. 2009; Sundby & Kristiansen 2015), further altering experienced conditions for the life stage most susceptible to climate change risk.

# Conclusions
Overall, this investigation supports published literature suggesting improvements to species distribution and correlative modelling by incorporating spatial scales below the species level where applicable. The conclusions of previous local-scale habitat suitability modelling studies may differ if species occurrences were considered from the broader population range. This investigation also suggests that species life cycles are a key consideration in correlative risk assessments, with buoyant S. lalandi eggs experiencing significantly higher climate risk levels than adult fish that experience conditions over a large depth range. While we find moderate average future climate risk levels in many locations under SSP2-4.5 for developed fish, the embryonic life stage experiences widespread high climate risk. Finally, our investigation shows highly heterogeneous spatial patterns in climate risk, allowing for the identification of potential refugia locations, along with locations that will be highly impacted by climate pressures.
